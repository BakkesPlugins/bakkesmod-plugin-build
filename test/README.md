# Test Plugin Source

This directory contains a minimal test plugin source for validating the build action.

## Structure

- `test.cpp` - Simple test plugin source file
- `CMakeLists.txt` - CMake configuration (if needed)
- `test.vcxproj` - Visual Studio project file (if needed)

This is used by the GitHub Actions workflow to test the build action functionality.
